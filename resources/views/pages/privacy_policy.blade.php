                    <p><strong>Security precautions in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information.</strong></p>

Any sensitive information (such as credit or debit card details) is encrypted and protected. On our websites when you are on a secure page, a lock icon <i class="fa fa-lock"></i> will appear on the in the address bar of most web browsers.

Once we receive your information, we make our very best efforts to ensure its security on our systems. When you set-up an account, say for example when you book an appointment at a Visa application centre, you are responsible for keeping that account password confidential and we ask you not to share your password with anyone</p>
                    <p><strong>Profiling.</strong></p>
                    <p>Profiling is any form of automated processing of personal information in order to analyse or predict behaviour. We don’t do that.</p>
