                                <p>Our prices are all inclusive, and there are no other charges that you will need to pay post booking the service.

                            <div class="accordion_body">
                                <p>No. But big changes should be advised. A big change is a change which will affect how, when and where the service you have booked is given. For example a big change would be a change in the named “lead” passenger, in the date of service, of the flight number, or a change in the kerbside meeting time for a departure, or a request for an additional feature (like a porter, buggy, lounge) or an increase in the number of passengers to be served. If in doubt email/call us.</p>

                            <div class="accordion_body">
                                <p>Each country airport has its own set of rules and regulations which may surpass the local service provider’s operating process. Sometimes there may be temporary security conditions made applicable at certain airports which may affect the available/included Fast Track service.  In such cases, these are force majeure beyond our control.</p>
